# Mulesoft_Salesforce_Hackaton
This code repository contains the files that have been developed for the Mullesoft and Salesforce Hackaton 2021 
This competition was organized in Spain by eCommerce News. 
we have set out to solve two problems for an e-commerce of personalized handbags 
the first one is the traffic acquisition through Google search and for which we have connected Satesforce Commerce Cloud with GPT3 for automatic copywriting
we have demonstrated 
  this on a product page that has been automatically expanded with texts generated by artificial intelligence 
  we improved e-commerce conversion by using a new chatBot to help customers select bags better and more easily through the selection of the bag, the selection of the cover and the selection of the badges that are part of the bag.
